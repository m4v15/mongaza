MongoDb workshop

Small workshop to show some basic uses of MongoDb with Mongoose. This repo is to accompany a code along, so may be hard to follow without someone to deliver it.

N.B. you will need a `.env` file with a `MONGODB_URI` in order to the mongoose files to work.

### Part 1

Just follows the mongoose docs, basic connecting to a database, nothing happens with the express server.

### Part 2

Seperating out the database connection and model, and making a build file, and connecting to the DB within our app.

Try to make the build file yourself, as well as filling out the empty routes in the app.js

### Part 3

Solutions to part 2!
